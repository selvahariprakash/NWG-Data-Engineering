Udacity Provided Project
In the Udacity provided project, you'll work with four datasets to complete the project. The main dataset will include data on immigration to the United States, and supplementary datasets will include data on airport codes, U.S. city demographics, and temperature data. You're also welcome to enrich the project with additional data if you'd like to set your project apart.
