Create zone tables for lakehouse architecture using AWS Glue and the AWS Data Catalog
Load data into zone tables using Glue Studio
Ingest sensitive data into a trusted zone
Process data into curated zone tables

Lakehouse Architecture
	Landing Zone - Data ingested from the source into the landing zone as-is
	Raw Zone - Processing layer validates the landing zone data and stores in
	Trusted Zone - Processing layer applies the schema, partitioning, and other transformationsto the raw zone to bring it to the 
	Curated Zone - Processing layer curates a trusted zone dataset by modelling and joining wiht other datasets and stores in

Use Glue Catalog to Query a Landing Zone
	Glue Data Catalog - represents many sources and destinations for data
	Glue Table - is a definition of a specific group of fields that represents a logical entity
		Glue tables are just a metadata catalog layer
		These tables are not physically stored in Glue
		They store a reference to the data we can query or store
		
	Three ways to define a Glue Table in a Glue Catalog:
		Use Glue Console to define each field
			AWS Athena - a Glue Catalog Query Tool
			Athena tool is a serverless query service where you can write SQL to run ad-hoc queries on S3 buckets
				(ad-hoc - a special and immediate purpose, without previous planning)
		Configure a Glue Job to generate a table definition automatically
		Use SQL to define a table with DDL (Data Definition Language) or create statements
